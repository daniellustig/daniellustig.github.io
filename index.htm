      <p>Hi!  I'm a research scientist in the System Architecture Research Group at NVIDIA.  I spend a lot of my time doing research on memory consistency models, from software to ISA to microarchitecture.  Some of my memory model work has gone to production: I co-authored the memory model for <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3297858.3304043">NVIDIA GPUs</a> and was the primary author of the RISC-V <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/">RVWMO</a> memory model.  I am now the point person for ongoing GPU memory model work at NVIDIA, where we are continually pushing the boundaries on enabling new hardware and software optimizations without sacrificing programmability.

      <p>I also do research on other assorted topics in the field of computer architecture.</p>
